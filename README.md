# 2015 Marriage Penalty Chart Builder

This repository is used to generate an SVG graphic in the browser illustrating the 2015 US income tax bonus or penalty incurred through marriage. This tool relies on precompiled CSV data and [D3.js](http://d3js.org/).

The data used to generate this graphic are sufficiently complex that an SVG graphic is not practical for display on websites. The charts generated with this tool are intended for conversion to raster and use as static images.
